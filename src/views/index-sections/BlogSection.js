                    The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the
                    sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will
                    continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the
                    Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of
                    the world, it will always be plunged into bitterly cold
                    polar dark every winter.

                    amount of ice will melt this summer.
